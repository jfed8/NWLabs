This website is an MVC prototype design as part of our preliminary analysis of a new technology platform for Northwest Labs. It includes, the views, models, and navigation. The views are hard coded with example data to provide the general layout of the forms. The models are created to mirror the database tables from the NWLabsSchema.sql We created basic navigation to each of views. 

The customers and employees have different views available to them. These views are available through the Customer and Employee login. For prototype purposes, we did not create user authentication and the customer and employee can login simply with any email and password.
